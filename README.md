Story of this game 📚

This project was developed as a freelancing project for a client who wanted to demonstrate dynamic blob mechanics in a modern engine. The client had an older game idea in mind and envisioned reimagining it with interactive merging and splitting behaviors. This collaboration was an opportunity to implement advanced mechanics while adhering to the vision of the original concept.

🎮 Demo 🎮

Unfortunately, there is no demo for this game at the moment as it is only a proof of concept.
