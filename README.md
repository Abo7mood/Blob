# Blob Project 🟠

Welcome to the **Blob Project**! 🟠 This is a **proof of concept (POC)** showcasing innovative mechanics involving blobs that dynamically merge and split based on user interaction. Built in Unity, this project demonstrates complex systems with interactive and visually engaging behavior.

## 🌟 Key Features 🌟

- **Blob Merging**: Watch as blobs seamlessly merge into larger entities when they come into contact. 🧩
- **Blob Splitting**: Interact with blobs by clicking to split them into smaller entities. ✂️
- **Complex Mechanics**: The project employs advanced logic to handle dynamic merging and splitting behaviors. ⚙️
- **Proof of Concept**: Focused on demonstrating the mechanics rather than being a complete game. 🔍

## 🔧 Technologies Used 🔧

- **Unity Engine** 🎮
- **C# Programming Language** 💻
- **Custom Physics and Interaction Systems** 🛠️

## ⚙️ Installation ⚙️

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abo7mood/Blob.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity (version 2021.1.16f1).
3. Build and run the project on your desired platform.

## 🛠️ Additional Information 🛠️

- **Made with Unity**: Developed using the Unity Engine to showcase complex blob mechanics.
- **Proof of Concept**: This project is a POC, focusing on the mechanics rather than full gameplay.
